# Convolutional Neural Network dan Recurrent Neural Network

## Overview
This project analyzes the effect of different architectures on the performance of **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**, **Simple Recurrent Neural Network (Simple RNN)**, and **Long-Short Term Memory Network (LSTM)** as part of the IF3270 Machine Learning course. This project also implements the aforementioned models from scratch.

## Requirements
### Libraries
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- Tensorflow (Keras)
- Seaborn

### Installation
```bash
pip install numpy scikit-learn matplotlib pandas tensorflow seaborn
```

## Project Structure
- `cnn.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook running experiments for CNN, as well as containing the implementation of CNN from scratch.
- `simplernn.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook running experiments for Simple RNN, as well as containing the implementation of Simple RNN from scratch.
- `lstm.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook running experiments for LSTM, as well as containing the implementation of LSTM from scratch.

## Usage
1. Open and run the corresponding ipynb: `cnn.ipynb`/`simplernn.ipynb`/`lstm.ipynb`
